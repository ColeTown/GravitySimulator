# GravitySimulator
Processing sketch that simulates basic gravitational interaction between multiple bodies.

I made this project as a quick little experiment when I took Physics 1 during the spring of 2020 and was going over gravity. This project features the equations that we learned in that course that determined the interactions of bodies because of gravity. 

The program is very simple and has no user interface when the program is running. If you want to edit the number of bodies, gravitational constant or other you need to go into the source and change the configurable variables. You can also play around with some preset body configurations that I have written out as well.
